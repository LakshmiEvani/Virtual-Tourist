#                            Udacity Fourth Project Virtual-tourist


Objective: 

This is an app that downloads and stores images from Flickr, based on a dropped pin location on a map.

Description:

The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.


We have implemented the following techniques inorder to complete the project: 

Use NSURLSessions to interact with a public restful API
Create a user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and download progress
Store media on the device file system Use Core Data for local persistence of an object structure
